Monad Example in Scala
======================

This example compliments the blog post I made at:

* [Monads in Scala](http://www.underflow.ca/blog/820/monads-in-scala)

To run the included example you must load the file from the scala interpreter:

	$ scala
	Welcome to Scala version 2.9.1.final (Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM, Java 1.6.0_29).
	Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
	Type :help for more information.

	scala> :load monads.scala
